A simple "Movie Discovery" web application that provides information about my favorite movies, as well as links to Wikipedia pages for each one.

-What are at least 2 technical issues I encountered with my project? 
1. One technical issue that I encountered was when I was printing out unwanted information for my genre of the movie. I didn't realize until later that I was working with an array of objects and I had to take a different approach.

How did I fix them?
1. I when to google and search for ways that I could approach my problem and found some solutions that allowed me to print out the information that I only need it.
